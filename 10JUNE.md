1. We take input from a user (e.g user_keyboard_input = input("blah blah blah"))
2. We proces that input users_keyboard_input / 4 or users_keyboard_input - 5
3. We show that users input (print)

4. We store (we did not see examples of storing as we will need a database or to create files)


String concatenation and interpolation

We got lumared (bitten) by variable types, so kahle kahle we kept getting a string form the keyboard
then we added that string to a number and we got concatenation e.g 1 + 1 = 11 instead of 2


There are 2 parts to programming:
1. Programming Logic / algorithm (the same in languages)
2. Syntax - the rules, the grammar and the spelling, different in each language


if (condition): or. {}
run the logic if true
else:
run the logic if false

We learned booleans an expressions
